The secret of the big guys
==========================

See [http://fastml.com/the-secret-of-the-big-guys/](http://fastml.com/the-secret-of-the-big-guys/) for description.

If interested, also check out [sofia-ml with sparse RBF mapping](https://github.com/zygmuntz/sofia-ml-mod), described in the article.

	kin8nm - Spearmint experiment for the kin8nm dataset
	madelon - Spearmint experiment for the madelon dataset
	
The code in these folders can also be run independently of Spearmint, using `run_once.py`. Either way, you will need sofia-ml and Vowpal Wabbit installed. We use VW because we like it, although there is also a linear learner in sofia-ml, so you can do both clustering and supervised learning just using sofia-ml.
